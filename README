Lab Assignment 1 - "Dictionary using Arrays"

github URL : https://github.com/440alexandra1588/CS2010-Assign1.git

To create the program : make Dictionary
To execute and use the text file provided : ./Dictionary <text.txt

This simple dictionary is designed to collect 20 words with a maximum of 15 
characters and count the frequency of how many times each word has been used in any
type of input.

IF the words are too long(exceeds 14 characters not including the null byte), or 
there are too many NEW words(more than 20) used in the file or the command line, 
the user will be given a gentle reminder that what they have input was too much. 
However the program will still run, cutting the words so it fits in the allocated 
space and not taking into consideration any word after the 20th word, except if it is a word that is already inside the array. In which case the frequency of the word 
will increment.
